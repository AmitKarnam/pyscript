## Code of Conduct

The project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [PyScript Code of Conduct](https://github.com/pyscript/governance/blob/main/CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to the maintainers or administrators.

## Contributing

### Reporting bugs

Bugs are tracked on the [project issues page](https://github.com/pyscript/pyscript/issues). Please check to see if your issue has already been filed by someone else by searching the existing issues before filing a new one. Once your issue is filed, it will be triaged by another contributor or maintainer. If there are questions raised about your issue, please respond promptly.

#### Creating useful issues

* Use a clear and descriptive title
* Describe the specific steps that reproduce the problem, with as many details as possible so that someone can verify the issue
* Describe the behavior you observed at the steps described, and the behavior you had expected
* include screenshots if they help make the issue clear

### Reporting security issues

If you aren't certain that it is appropriate to submit a security issue using the above process, you can e-mail it to security@pyscript.net

### Asking questions

If you have questions about the project, using PyScript, or anything else please ask in the [PyScript forum](https://community.anaconda.cloud/c/tech-topics/pyscript)
